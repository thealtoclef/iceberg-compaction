# Compaction Runtime for Apache Iceberg™

**Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation. “Apache”, “Apache Iceberg”, and related marks are trademarks of the ASF.

`iceberg-compaction` is a high-performance Rust-based engine that compacts Apache Iceberg™ tables efficiently and safely at scale.

## 🌟 Core Highlights

- **Rust-Native Performance**: Low-latency, high-throughput compaction with memory safety guarantees
- **DataFusion Engine**: Leverages Apache DataFusion for query planning and vectorized execution
- **Iceberg Native Support**: Full compliance with Iceberg table formats via iceberg-rs
- **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Currently supports AWS S3, with plans for Azure Blob Storage and GCP Cloud Storage

## 🛠️ Basic Functionality

- **Full Compaction**: Merges all data files in an Iceberg table and removes old files
- **Deletion Support**:
  - Positional deletions (POS_DELETE)
  - Equality deletions (EQ_DELETE)

## 📝 Examples

### REST Catalog Example

We provide a complete working example using a REST catalog. This example demonstrates how to use iceberg-compaction for Iceberg table compaction with a REST catalog backend:

```bash
# Navigate to the example directory
cd examples/rest-catalog

# Run the example
cargo run
```

The example includes:
- Setting up a REST Iceberg catalog with S3 storage
- Configuring authentication and connection settings
- Performing table compaction using iceberg-compaction

For more details, see the [rest-catalog example](./examples/rest-catalog/).

### Benchmark Tool

See the [bench binary CLI reference](./docs/bench-cli.md) for benchmarking compaction performance with mock data.

### Other Examples

|---------|-------------|---------|
| `memory-catalog` | In-memory catalog for testing | `cargo run -p iceberg-compaction-example-memory` |
| `cleanup` | Snapshot expiration and orphan cleanup | `cargo run -p cleanup-example` |
